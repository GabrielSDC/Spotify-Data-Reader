How to visualize Spotify's streaming data (ie. top artists and tracks) in a JSON file

## What you need

- A JSON file with all the data you want to vizualize (details on it can be found here: https://support.spotify.com/uk/article/understanding-my-data/)
- Python 3.12

## Limitations

For now, only one JSON file is opened, so (if needed) you can join all the data into one single JSON file
